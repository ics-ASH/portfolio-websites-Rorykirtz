<br> <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:15;" >Raspberry Pie</h1>    <h1 style="text-align: right;">   Feb 20  </h1>
<br>
  <h1>  Raspberry pi’s were created in 2012 in the uk. Though computers are a widely used device, in many developing countries they are hard to access, this is where the raspberry pie comes in. They are a low costing single computer board around the size of a credit card. They were created to be widely accessible while still being affordable and useful. Raspberry pi’s are mini-computers that are able to exchange and process information from multiple different devices.  They are often used to learn programming or for data management. A raspberry pie has similar features to a motherboard while taking out things that are not necessary such as its internal storage. To use a raspberry pi you'll need an sd card which contains an operating system, which is needed for the computer to work. Raspberry pie’s are compatible with the linux os which reduces the amount of storage required. After setting up the os to the raspberry pie you can connect the raspberry pie to monitors ,hdmis television, mice and keyboards as an output device.

    Raspberry Pis have many features that make them a popular and very versatile tool. These include: CPU, HDMI and USB ports, GPU, Memory, an Ethernet port, an SD card, and GPIO pins. The CPU or Central Processing Unit acts as the main base of operations for the Raspberry pi and is used to perform actions using logical and mathematical operations. An HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) is useful because it gives options for video output, and it has a USB port for connecting to other devices. The GPU or Graphic Processing Unit helps the Raspberry Pi to make quicker calculations. It has memory to store real-time information to be easily referred to later. It has an Ethernet port for wired internet access. A Secure Digital card is used instead as a storage device and is necessary for it to function, as it contains the operating system that turns it on and is used to store data. GPIO pins are General Purpose Input and Output pins that can be used to interact with other electronic circuits and can be programmed to read and control electronic signals from other boards. Finally, it has LEDs with different colors to show different things, like if it is powered on or to monitor Ethernet connection. </h1>

    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:15;" >MotherBoard</h1>
    <h1 style="text-align: right;">   Feb 27  </h1>  
    <h1>A motherboard is a piece of internal hardware. They distribute electricity and control communication between the cpu and ram. There are many types of motherboards that are each compatible with specific computers each depending on the size, processors and memory whereas they can all work with a variety of hard drives. On the earlier versions of motherboards there were fewer components, they usually had a cpu and card ports, users had to add things like memory and controllers for floppy drives like on the first IBM PC motherboard.
<br>
<br>
        When you use your computer electricity is transferred to the motherboard, data is then moved between the chipset components and travels between the southbridge and northbridge sections which interact with other parts of the computer such as CPU,RAM,PCI and pcIe through electrical signals that pass through a microchip to either bridge. The information sent will be encoded through binary and translated in a split second. The northbridge helps data connections to the ram, operations from the ram are interpreted by the cpu and acts as the output after the ram delivers the inputs. After information is sent to the PCIe, the data is copied or moved to an expansion card, depending on the card you are using. The southbridge controls data connection to the BIOS, USB and the SATA. Your computer turns on because of the signals going to the BIOS and the data going to the SATA, which turns on your optical, hard disc and solid state drives. The information saved on the SATA gives power to many things such as the video card, sound card and the network card.

    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:15;" >Black-Box</h1>
    <h1 style="text-align: right;">   Feb 27  </h1>
 <h1>   An AI black box is a Ai system whose software is invisible to the user. You can put in an input and get an output but can’t see the internal workings of the system's code or logic.
<br>
<br>
    Ai uses something called machine learning, it uses algorithms, training data and a model.They learn how to identify patterns after being trained with an extensive set of examples. Once the algorithm has been trained the result is a machine learning model, this model is what people use for things such as Chat GBT and DALL-E2. For example they would be able to identify patterns such as in images looking for a specific object, you would feed the algorithm images and get an output on whether they have that object or not.
<br>
<br>
     In a black box any of the components that make up machine learning can be hidden but in many cases the algorithm is already known defeating the purpose of having the black box. So in many cases they would put the training into the black box to stop others from seeing the information .
     <br>
     <br>
    Black boxes may appear to be a good idea, however they can cause more harm than good. These algorithms are not transparent with users and there is no way for people to know the machine’s reasoning behind the decisions it makes. The reason for black boxes is to stop hackers from accessing the code. This does not completely work because of the option of reverse engineering software. In conclusion, black boxes are not all that helpful when it comes to AI that could impact people.
