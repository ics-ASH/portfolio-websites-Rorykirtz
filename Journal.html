<br> <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:20;" >Week 1</h1>   
<br>
  <h1 style=" font-size:15;"> This week we learned about what to expect within the course, about our RST’s our projects and what future classes would look like if we continued down this path, such as what coding languages we would be learning.A bit later in the week we watched hidden figures, we learned about the people who helped so much to advance our technology that we often don’t talk about such as women and Black people.</h1>

<article>
<br> <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:20;" >Week 3</h1>   
<br>
<h1 style=" font-size:15;"> This week we started doing a typing club everyday for about 10 minutes and did our very first Tech Tuesday. Me and Sophia talk about Raspberry pies and how they are useful for beginners to learn python.We also started looking at Binary, a system for coders to talk to computers through numbers.</h1>

<article>
<br> <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:20;" >Week 4</h1>   
<br>
<h1 style=" font-size:15;"> This week we learned about Binary. Binary is a series of 1’s and 0’s that can create complex code. Though we don’t use binary very often it is important to understand the base of where code comes from. We can use Binary to create images, sounds and programs. We learned how to properly add and subtract it and furthered our understanding of coding.</h1>

<br> <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:20;" >Week 5</h1>   
<br>
<h1 style=" font-size:15;"> This week we used CMU to further our understanding of python. We created images using circles, rectangles and irregular polygons. We also learned about RGB and gradients as a way to add more dimension to these pictures. We did a final project where I used these new skills to create a sunset, a little boat and some islands, using gradients to create the ombre effect and ovals to create shadows. </h1>

<br> <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:20;" >Week 7</h1>   
<br>
<h1 style=" font-size:15;"> We spent this week working on our websites. I learned more about things like layouts using sections and articles to help split up my website and make it more appealing. I added a bookmarks page and my Tech Tuesday page so i could better showcase my work.</h1>

<article>
<br> <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:20;" >Week 8</h1>   
<br>
<h1 style=" font-size:15;"> This week we learned about AI, we talked about how it is trained/developed and both the benefits and the issues behind it. Through Code HS we learned about the training process using sources such as images, texts or videos to help create the algorithm, understand emotion through text and speech and how these training resources can also cause the AI to create a bias. We also looked at self-driving cars. We learned about how they can be an amazing resources and make things more accessible, but they are also easily hacked, can cause accidents and make companies more money while laying off more people.</h1>

<br> <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:20;" >Week 9</h1>   
<br>
<h1 style=" font-size:15;">This week we continued using Code HS to learn about AI and did a final Project talking about ethics and the pros and cons about different parts of AI.This Week we started doing Challenges on Our Raspberry Pie, me and sophia made coloured lines both vertically, horizontally and diagonally in different colours, completing the beginner challenges. </h1>

<article>
 <br> <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:20;" >Week 10</h1>   
<br>
<h1 style=" font-size:15;">This week we learned about creating functions. We use definitions and parentheses to make functions we can call on multiple times throughout our code. We can also make things move using “onMouseClick” and "onMouseRelease” creating new images that can be interacted with.</h1>

<article>
<br> <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:20;" >Week 11</h1>   
<br>
<h1 style=" font-size:15;"> This week we had a test on what we learned during week 10. We also started our final projects for unit 2. I am doing a garden, when you click a watering can appears and when you reliase the flowers grow. I made the flowers a function so i don't have to draw them individually and made the sun and moon a variable so i could hid or make them visable instead of drawing and covering them.</h1>

<br> <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:20;" >Week 12</h1>   
<br>
<h1 style=" font-size:15;"> This week we continued to work on our Unit 2 CMU projects. I added a sun, moon,sunbeam and sky variables so i would be able to change the time of day when you click and realice. Me and Sophia made strobe lights that flash red and blue on raspberry pie and moved on to the advanced code challanges, which we will continue next week.   </h1>

<br> <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;" >Week 13</h1>   
<br>
<h1 style=" font-size:15;"> This week we learned about hardware. We took apart a pc and put it back together while learning about the different parts like the motherboard, the fan and the power supply. Me, sophia and izzy then did a project on peripherals. Peripherals are devices that attach to a computer to expand their abilities like headphones, keyboards, mouses and monitors.They can both be both wireless and wired with varying uses. On wednesday me and sophia continued to work on the advanced section on our raspberry pies, changing the whole raspberry pie to a colour based off of an input by the viewer. We then did a project about how we would make our dream computers, for different uses. For my project I chose to create a computer for a photographer. For this project we either had to build or buy a computer, choose proper hardware, choose an operating system, networking,software and choose a way to properly maintain it such as apps with firewalls and antivirus software.   </h1>

<br> <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;" >Week 14</h1>   
<br>
<h1 style=" font-size:15;"> This week we finished up our computer project. I added a printer and added a few other apps that i thought i would need. On Tuesday we started building kate(K8) a robot that we would learn to use throughout the week. Starting with moving her, coding her sensors to stop her and turn her around if there was anything in her way. For CSE this week we redid a few of our older challanges and tyred to organises oour challanges so we would be able to find them more easliy.  </h1>

    <br>
    <h1 style=" font-size:15;"> This week we got remotes for our kate. We learned how to move her through the buttons on a second microbit. While also using tilting the microbit to move it side to side. On Friday we made posters for the robot battle will will have next week.My group made a poster that has a little kate on it. On click her eyes turn red and there is a little flame behind her but when you releace it goes back to normal.  </h1>

        <br>
        <h1 style=" font-size:15;"> This week we had a free run with our raspberry pies. We got to play around with them and i finished up the advanced challanges by creating a rainbow, slightly chnaging clours through the collums. This week we finished up coding and enhancing it by attaching the pin. We also added our ballons to kate and practiced driving her around. We also made the boarders for the arena for the battles. My group drew some bricks, a rubex cube, a trophy and a few other randome things.   </h1>
