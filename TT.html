  <h1 style="font-size:15;"> Raspberry pi’s were created in 2012 in the uk. Though computers are a widely used device, in many developing countries they are hard to access, this is where the raspberry pie comes in. They are a low costing single computer board around the size of a credit card. They were created to be widely accessible while still being affordable and useful. Raspberry pi’s are mini-computers that are able to exchange and process information from multiple different devices.  They are often used to learn programming or for data management. A raspberry pie has similar features to a motherboard while taking out things that are not necessary such as its internal storage. To use a raspberry pi you'll need an sd card which contains an operating system, which is needed for the computer to work. Raspberry pie’s are compatible with the linux os which reduces the amount of storage required. After setting up the os to the raspberry pie you can connect the raspberry pie to monitors ,hdmis television, mice and keyboards as an output device. 
<br>
<Br>
    Raspberry Pis have many features that make them a popular and very versatile tool. These include: CPU, HDMI and USB ports, GPU, Memory, an Ethernet port, an SD card, and GPIO pins. The CPU or Central Processing Unit acts as the main base of operations for the Raspberry pi and is used to perform actions using logical and mathematical operations. An HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface) is useful because it gives options for video output, and it has a USB port for connecting to other devices. The GPU or Graphic Processing Unit helps the Raspberry Pi to make quicker calculations. It has memory to store real-time information to be easily referred to later. It has an Ethernet port for wired internet access. A Secure Digital card is used instead as a storage device and is necessary for it to function, as it contains the operating system that turns it on and is used to store data. GPIO pins are General Purpose Input and Output pins that can be used to interact with other electronic circuits and can be programmed to read and control electronic signals from other boards. Finally, it has LEDs with different colors to show different things, like if it is powered on or to monitor Ethernet connection. </h1>

    <h1 style="font-size:15;">A motherboard is a piece of internal hardware. They distribute electricity and control communication between the cpu and ram. There are many types of motherboards that are each compatible with specific computers each depending on the size, processors and memory whereas they can all work with a variety of hard drives. On the earlier versions of motherboards there were fewer components, they usually had a cpu and card ports, users had to add things like memory and controllers for floppy drives like on the first IBM PC motherboard.
<br>
<br>
        When you use your computer electricity is transferred to the motherboard, data is then moved between the chipset components and travels between the southbridge and northbridge sections which interact with other parts of the computer such as CPU,RAM,PCI and pcIe through electrical signals that pass through a microchip to either bridge. The information sent will be encoded through binary and translated in a split second. The northbridge helps data connections to the ram, operations from the ram are interpreted by the cpu and acts as the output after the ram delivers the inputs. After information is sent to the PCIe, the data is copied or moved to an expansion card, depending on the card you are using. The southbridge controls data connection to the BIOS, USB and the SATA. Your computer turns on because of the signals going to the BIOS and the data going to the SATA, which turns on your optical, hard disc and solid state drives. The information saved on the SATA gives power to many things such as the video card, sound card and the network card.

    <h1 style="text-align: right;font-size:15;">   March 19  </h1>
 <h1 style="font-size:15;">   An AI black box is a Ai system whose software is invisible to the user. You can put in an input and get an output but can’t see the internal workings of the system's code or logic.
<br>
<br>
    Ai uses something called machine learning, it uses algorithms, training data and a model.They learn how to identify patterns after being trained with an extensive set of examples. Once the algorithm has been trained the result is a machine learning model, this model is what people use for things such as Chat GBT and DALL-E2. For example they would be able to identify patterns such as in images looking for a specific object, you would feed the algorithm images and get an output on whether they have that object or not.
<br>
<br>
     In a black box any of the components that make up machine learning can be hidden but in many cases the algorithm is already known defeating the purpose of having the black box. So in many cases they would put the training into the black box to stop others from seeing the information .
     <br>
     <br>
    Black boxes may appear to be a good idea, however they can cause more harm than good. These algorithms are not transparent with users and there is no way for people to know the machine’s reasoning behind the decisions it makes. The reason for black boxes is to stop hackers from accessing the code. This does not completely work because of the option of reverse engineering software. In conclusion, black boxes are not all that helpful when it comes to AI that could impact people.

    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:30;" >Block-Chains<img src="https://www.pngmart.com/files/23/Blockchain-PNG-HD-Isolated.png" style="width:50px"></h1>
    <h1 style="text-align: right;font-size:15;">   April 23  </h1>
 <h1 style="font-size:15;">  Blockchains are databases shared by multiple computer networks. They are made up of multiple unchangeable blocks, linked together by something called cryptography - a way to secure data from hackers. Blockchains are similar and different to spreadsheets and typical databases. They are similar because they are all used to enter and store data, and different because of how the data is structured and accessed. Blockchains collect transaction information and enter it into a block. It is then encrypted by creating a hexadecimal number called the hash. Next, the hash is entered into another block and encrypted, which creates a series of blocks. New blocks get stored by adding them to the end of the blockchain, and it prevents previous blocks from being altered. 
   <br>
<br>
    There are many pros and cons to block chains. First let's talk about the pros. One pro is removing a third party, because you no longer have a third person verifying transactions there are less fees for transferring money. It can help keep personal information secure in unstable and underdeveloped governments and because it would not be controlled by one big group it makes it harder to tamper with.it also has a higher accuracy in verification because human involvement is removed.
    <br>
    <br>
    There are also many cons. When using blockchains there are serious data storage limitations and the regulation varies from place to place. There is also a lot of history of people using them for illicit activities such as on the dark web and because the technology needed for block chains are extremely expensive.

 <h1 style="font-size:15;"> 
    Computers and robots have been developing at a rapid rate but something that developers have been struggling with has been recreating a human grasp. Recently there has been a big development by MIT, completely changing the way robotic hands were created. This hand is called GelPalm. They started using advanced spencers for more sensitive movements, helping the robot handle objects more delicately and more precisely 
<br>
<br>
    They also have finger bones called ROMEO (Robotic Modular Endoskeleton Optical) using flexible materials and similar sensory technology as the palm. They added something called “passive control” which means a robot can adjust to pressure and weight naturally without the need of extra motors or added control. 
    <br>
    <br>
    The Gel Palm has safe interactions with objects which will help greatly in human-robot interactions, with prosthetics and the overall function of robots. They were inspired by human hands with their rigid bones and soft tissue.By combining rigid objects with soft and compliant materials they act more similarly to human hands, conforming around objects just like our hands do.
    <br>  
    <br>
    The palm was tested on different illumination systems, blue LEDs and white LEDs, which were a part of the robot’s fingers. They were able to make 3D reconstructions when ‘pressing objects into the gel surfaces’. Liu and her team also tested how the palm could grab different types of objects, making it difficult by coating some in paint. 
    <br>
    <br>
    One difficulty they encountered was being able to include enough sensory technology in the palm while keeping it at a good size and flexibility, because the sensors are camera based, and the technology for them is not yet as advanced as it would need to be.
    <br>
    <br>
    The hope is that in the future this technology will be useful for developing more complex robotic hands with similar capabilities to human hands, a very difficult task.

    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:30;" >IOT</h1>
    <h1 style="text-align: right;font-size:15;">   May 28  </h1>
 <h1 style="font-size:15;"> 
    The dark web is a marketplace where unlawful activities occur while being anonymous. IOT(the internet of things) is deeply connected and vulnerable, it has become a target for cybercriminals by those who work through the dark web. One week deceive can cause an entire network to be breached. The consequences of a breached device are large and have big repercussions such as ransom,fines and loss of reputation. 
<br>
<br>
    IOT devices are a great entry point for cybercriminals, they are a single point of vulnerability that allows them to attack multiple people at the same time. In the last 3 years researchers have found a large increase in cyber attacks surrounding IOT devices across the world, Europe experiencing the most attacks at around 70 per week per organization. Each successful attack on an IOT device causes over $330,000.
<br>
<br>
    Combining Ai and IoT has resulted in an increase in web-originated attacks, to levels never seen before. These attacks include automated exploitation, where AI scans for vulnerabilities and security flaws, creating an attack without any human involvement, adaptive attacks, where AI helps attackers by analyzing defenses and helping them adapt, behavioral analysis, where AI analysis IoT devices and how they are used to find patterns that can be used by hackers, and adversarial attacks, which can be used to trick AI models and IoT devices so they will make bad decisions and leave themselves open to attacks. This is why it is so important for IoT devices to have security measures put in place to protect their data.
