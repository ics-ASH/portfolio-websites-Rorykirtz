<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:20;"> Creative task 1</h1>
<br>
<h2 style="font-size:15;"> For this porject I used things such as gradient, polygons and opacity to create a sunset. I used irregualr polygons to create a boat, islands and sunbeams. I sued gradient to create the sunset and start for gradient to make sure it looked like the light was coming from the sky and slowly fading to blue. I also used oppacity to add more dpeth to the sky and the sunbeams. I use triangles (regular polygons) to create small islands in the distance and ovals to create reflections on the water. I also made sure that the sun was above the water in the code so that it covers the bottom of the sun in the picture.      </h2>

    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:20;"> Creative task 2</h1>
    <br>
    <h2 style="font-size:15;">For this Project Westarted to use on mouse click and on mouse release to create images that react to when you click to change the image. For my project i set variables for the sun, the moon and the stars to make them show depending on when you click or release.Then i also made a function to create flowers instead of drawing them each time.I added a counter so that the flowers won't apper ontop of eachother and cause an overflow error. I wrote the code for each piece of the flooring individual, using gradient to add a bit more detail. I added a function for the pots so i didn't have to rewrite the code and I drew the background using a gradient aswell to help add colour and deepth to the picture.</h2>

  <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:20;"> Birthday Cards</h1>
  <br>
  <h2 style="font-size:15;">For this project we had to make a birthday card. I set the background through app.background using rgb and then added a square with a gradient of white and the original rgb used for the background ontop of it to add more dimention. I added circles with diffrent levels of opacity to make thr cornors look bubbly.I also added a function to add ballons that appear on mouse click, i created it so that there would be an oval a tiny triangle and a string at the bottom and set it for locations all around the drawing.</h2>

  <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:20;"> Robot Battle</h1>
  <br>
  <h2 style="font-size:15;" >For this Project we had to create aposter for our robot battles with K8. My group made a little robot K8 with a little hat and both eyes as variables so they can be changed later in our code. ON mouse click got her eyes to turn red, put a flashlight on her, bolded and increased the size of the lighting as well as changing the colour to red. ON mouse realice everything goes back to normal.We added stars with abunch of points to add a bit more demention and a function of little stars to the background.</h2>

  <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size:20;"> AI Detectives</h1>
  <br>
  <h2 style="font-size:15;"> For this project we had to make a presentation about 5 ways AI is used in everyday life. We talked about the spotify dj,auto-correct,wireless pay, face ID and the instagram algorithum. We used block code to create mini games for the class to play along with information on the diffrent ways ai is used. We talked about the pros and cons of each AI and talked about the potential wAys that ai can be used in the future and how it will continue to develope into more complex systems.</h2>
