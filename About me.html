     <h1 style=" font-size:18; text-align: right;">At school you can find me all over the place. Anywhere from sports teams like hockey or track and field or at clubs like k-pop, YCO or at the student council as a grade rep. Next year i am going to be a leader for leadership camp and will be running k-pop with another girl from my grade. I love participating in spirit days and try to be an active member of our school community. Next year i plan on joining a few more teams like Softball and cross contry and joining the tech club.</h1>

     <h1 style=" font-size:18;"> I have a lot of diffrent hobbies.I enjoy physical things like sprinting(I strongly dislike long distance running but am planning on trying it more next year) and swimming. I recently have been training to be a lifeguard, i have completed my bronze madalian and hopefully if i pass will be certified in bronze cross by the end of the semester. I love drawing and have recently started drawing online.It was a very big switch but i like the new aspects that come with drawing online.I also love reading anything from fantasy, dystopian and mystery.My favorite books are probably fish in a tree and the 7 husbands of evelyn hugo. I am currently reading daisy Jones and the 6. It is about a band in the 70's, how they meet and how their band slowly falls appart. </h1>
